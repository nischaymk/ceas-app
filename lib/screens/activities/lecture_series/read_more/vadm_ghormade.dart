              'he began the lecture by tracing the roots of the Indian Navy to the subcontinentâ€™s ancient civilisations and the Rigveda. The seafaring nature of the Indian civilisation is evidenced by artifacts '
              'and motifs depicting seafaring activities from the Harappan civilisation and across 10th century BCE, and the ship might of the Marathas kept foreign conquerors at bay for decades. '
              'It was interesting to learn that Mudra in the Naval Ensign is also derived from ancient traces, depicting the Indian Navyâ€™s duty and capacity to protect from all dimensions.\n\n'
              'The Admiral discussed how Indiaâ€™s naval assets have grown since the Independence from comparison 3% to 19.7% of the budget. The Navy has improved in its scope and involvement immensely, underscored by its '
              'efficient maritime operations over the decades. The Navyâ€™s objectives extend beyond defense, encompassing nation-building. Not only does the Navy provide maritime security, but it plays a significant role in '
              'international relations as well. The lecture highlighted the Indian Navyâ€™s primary roles to be military, diplomatic, constabulary, and humanitarian. The Admiral also highlighted the Navyâ€™s goal towards Atmanirbhata '
              'with its shipbuilding efforts and progress since 1947. He pointed out that the Navyâ€™s existing submarines are already 90% indigenous, with ongoing and future assets aiming for 95%.',

              'the vast maritime area is used as points of infiltration. For India, Chinaâ€™s rapid expansion of its naval assets and monitoring activities in the Indian Ocean pose significant challenges. The Indian Navy closely monitors Chinese ships and submarines to safeguard national interests. '
